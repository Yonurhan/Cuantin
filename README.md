# 🍽️ Cuantin — Restaurant Management Web Application

Cuantin is a full-stack restaurant management system built with Laravel and MySQL.  
It allows Guests to explore outlets and menus, Members to make reservations,  
and Admins to manage all restaurant data through a secure dashboard.

The application implements **authentication**, **role-based access control**, and **database-driven features**  
to streamline reservation workflows and improve operational efficiency for restaurants.

## 🎯 Why Cuantin?

Restaurants often need a simple and efficient way to handle reservations, menus,  
and outlet management without complicated systems. Cuantin centralizes these tasks  
into one convenient platform.

This project was developed to strengthen backend and full-stack engineering skills  
through real-world data handling and system architecture.
